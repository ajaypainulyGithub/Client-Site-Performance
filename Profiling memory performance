 **DevTools to find memory issues that affect page performance**

    Memory issues are important because they are often perceivable by users. Users can perceive memory issues in the following ways:

*************************************A page's performance gets progressively worse over time********************************************
This is possibly a symptom of a memory leak.
A memory leak is when a bug in the page causes the page to progressively use more and more memory over time.

*****************************************A page's performance is consistently bad********************************************************
This is possibly a symptom of memory bloat.
Memory bloat is when a page uses more memory than is necessary for optimal page speed.
A page's performance is delayed or appears to pause frequently. This is possibly a symptom of frequent garbage collections. 
Garbage collection is when the browser reclaims memory.
The browser decides when this happens. During collections, all script execution is paused. So if the browser is garbage collecting a lot, 
script execution is going to get paused a lot.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Monitor memory use in realtime with the Chrome Task Manager<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Use the Chrome Task Manager as a starting point to your memory issue investigation. 
The Task Manager is a realtime monitor that tells you how much memory a page is currently using.

Press Shift+Esc or go to the Chrome main menu and select More tools > Task manager to open the Task Manager.
